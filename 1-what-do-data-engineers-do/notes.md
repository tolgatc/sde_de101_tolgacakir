# Assignment:

Imagine that you are hired to enable data analytics; where would you start? How would you go about gathering requirements? Hint: Think backward from what the business may need. Share your assignment with me by creating a repo (like this one if you haven't already) and writing down your notes/code under the folder for lesson 1.

#Answer:
I would start by going in discussion with stakeholders from the business needs.

From the stakeholders I would rank the desired outcomes of a data solution, in terms of business impact and need.

From this I would pick a project that we would start working on first.

Next I would start gathering all data sources to understand what are the data sources.

This would be the point to discuss how the data should be structured. I think this is also where data modelling comes into play.

At this point that we know all data sources, the scope of the project it would be good timing to review with relevant stakeholders, what they like to see.

However, I would make some initial suggestion with what they could do with the data, like biweekly report of sales, number of failures of assembly line e.g.

From here I would like to understand what is the key metric a decision maker uses/needs for their business.
