Assignment:

Imagine that you are hired to enable data analytics; where would you start? How would you go about gathering requirements? Hint: Think backward from what the business may need. Share your assignment with me by creating a repo (like this one if you haven't already) and writing down your notes/code under the folder for lesson 1.
